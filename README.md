# Auto-DLL

Automatically updates but doesn't actually execute scripts lol. Just grabs the addresses and *replaces* them.

```cpp
DWORD deserialize = 0x0;
DWORD spawn = 0x0;
DWORD print = 0x0;
#define WINAPI _cdecl //haha so funni!!1!
```

Please *do not* take the **comments** seriously. Also i wrote this on my school laptop on github C++ editor so sry for errors.
